//! A fact is evidence. It is never an amount, never a decision and never a credential — and here it
//! is never the decision CONTENT either. jev's `systemone` request carries a caller-supplied
//! `state`; its response (success or 422) carries the provider's `answers`. Both are the payload a
//! `decision` plane exists to move, not evidence a fact map should carry forward into a record or
//! an export. So this module declares metadata keys ONLY, and `codec.rs`'s declared-pointer list —
//! the only pointers this plane ever resolves — has no entry for either member. A key that is never
//! declared here cannot leak through `Facts::set`, because nothing in this crate ever builds the
//! value to set it to.
