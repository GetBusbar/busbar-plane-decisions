//! The decisions plane: what bytes mean, for the `jev` dialect.
//!
//! ## What this crate is
//!
//! An ADAPTER, over a protocol this crate speaks for itself rather than borrowing from a codec
//! crate one hop away: jev is two small HTTP+JSON operations (`POST /v1/systemone`,
//! `GET /v1/models`), byte-identity passthrough to `api.typesafe.ai`, and there is no separate
//! wire vocabulary crate to adapt over the way `busbar-llm-codec` still exists for
//! their planes. The signed design (DECISION #39, jev v5 sign-off) rules this deliberately: ONE
//! crate, not a pure-plane-plus-impure-host split. See `Cargo.toml`'s header for why that also
//! means this crate names `busbar-substrate` — a widening its pure siblings do not carry.
//!
//! ## What this crate is not
//!
//! It holds no governance, no breaker, no hook seat, no signing key and no arithmetic over a
//! metered quantity. Those are units, and a unit is on the far side of the kernel from a plane. The
//! metering method here returns LOCATORS — the class, and the quantity this codec already read off
//! a SUCCESS response — and never a price, never a hold and never a decision. The routing method
//! returns a plan and never a connection. Nothing in this crate opens a socket, reads a file or
//! reads a clock other than the one the context hands it.
//!
//! ## What it holds across calls
//!
//! Nothing. The plane is a value with no interior mutability, asserted by a test rather than by a
//! comment. jev's two operations are each complete in one request/response pair — there is no
//! streamed answer and no task-like durable state — so this plane keeps no per-connection codec
//! state beyond what every plane's session machinery already provides.
//!
//! ## The PII witness, stated once
//!
//! A `systemone` exchange carries a caller-supplied `state` and the provider's `answers` — the
//! decision content itself. This plane never reads either: every pointer it resolves is declared in
//! `codec.rs`, and neither `state` nor `answers` is on that list. The body is still forwarded
//! byte-identically (the point of a passthrough dialect), but nothing this plane READS — no fact,
//! no record leg, no content fact — can ever carry those bytes, because it never looked at them.
//! `tests/jev.rs::pii_witness_never_surfaces_state_or_answers_in_any_fact` drives a fixture whose
//! body echoes both and asserts no fact this plane emits contains either value.
