//! What relaying an unchanged jev body is allowed to allocate.
//!
//! jev's `encode_egress` forwards the caller's body UNCHANGED — there is no task-identifier rewrite
//! the way A2A's relay has, because `systemone` mints no busbar-side identifier a later call would
//! need to substitute. So the honest allocation count is smaller than A2A's own pinned baseline: the
//! body is borrowed where it already lives, and the only copy this call makes is the envelope's
//! `content-type` field.
